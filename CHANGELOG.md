as a library inside another project:

- Completely refactor the rendering part of the grapher by making it more extensible in order to support Mermaid.
- Fill the plays, blocks and node with color to make them more visible in the output
- Rename the file `graph.py` to `graph_model.py`
- Use the concatenation of the playbook names as the output filename when graphing multiple playbooks instead of the
  first playbook.
