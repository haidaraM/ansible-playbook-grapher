# Ansible Playbook Grapher

ansible-playbook-grapher is a command line tool to create a graph representing your Ansible playbook tasks and roles. The aim of
this project is to quickly have an overview of your playbook.

Inspired by [Ansible Inventory Grapher](https://github.com/willthames/ansible-inventory-grapher).

## PÃ©requis
 * **Ansible** >= 2.4: The script has not been tested yet with an earlier version of Ansible. 
 ```
 $ sudo pip3 install 'ansible>=2.4'
 ```
 * **graphviz**: The tool used to generate the graph in SVG. 
 ```
 $ sudo apt-get install graphviz
 ```
 
## Installation
```
$ sudo pip3 install ansible-playbook-grapher
```

## Usage

```
$ ansible-playbook-grapher examples/playbook.yml

![Example](examples/example.png)

Some options are available:

```
$ ansible-playbook-grapher --help
usage: ansible-playbook-grapher [-h] [-i INVENTORY] [--include-role-tasks]
                                [-s] [-o OUTPUT_FILE_NAME] [-v]
                                playbook

Simple grapher for an Ansible Playbook. You will need to install Ansible,
graphviz on your system (sudo apt-get install graphviz). Has been tested with
Ansible 2.4.

positional arguments:
  playbook              The playbook to grah.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INVENTORY, --inventory INVENTORY
                        Ansible inventory. Useful if you want to have a
                        tooltip with hostnames on the play nodes.
  --include-role-tasks  Include the tasks of the role in the graph. Can
                        produce a huge graph if you have lot of roles.
  -s, --save-dot-file   Save the dot file used to generate the graph.
  -o OUTPUT_FILE_NAME, --ouput-file-name OUTPUT_FILE_NAME
                        Output filename without the '.svg' extension. Default:
                        <playbook_filename>.svg
  -v, --version         Print version and exit.

```


## TODO
 - Graphviz : properly rank the edge of the graph to represent the order of the execution of the tasks and roles
 - Graphviz : find a way to avoid edges overlapping
 - Ansible: Variables interpolation in node name (when possible)
